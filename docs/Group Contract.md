# Section 1. Terms and conditions of group work
Role-Based Task Allocation

The team utilizes predefined roles to clarify individual responsibility as follows:

Architect: (responsible for system architecture, Github management, and integration) - Carlos Cordoba

Documentation Lead: (responsible for report preparation and Architectural Decision Records preparation) - Gaurab Gaihre

Feature Lead: (responsible for developing the application features) - Pralin Dhungana

History/Tracking Lead: (responsible for commit tracking and progress documentation) - Umme Habiba

The Architect will be responsible for maintaining the overall system architecture, organizing the repository, and ensuring successful integration.

i. Task Coordination

Task planning is done using Microsoft Teams, while progress is maintained using GitHub Issues. Tasks will be divided into small components, such as research, back-end development, front-end development, and documentation, with individual responsible for each task.

ii. Criteria for Completing a Task

A task is considered complete once it has been committed to GitHub, reviewed by at least one team member, relevant feedback has been provided, and the task meets all assignment criteria.

iii. Collaboration Responsibility

It is everyone's duty to review progress and provide necessary assistance to fellow team members, and help each other on common tasks like integration and testing.

iv. Conflict Resolution

All conflicts between team members will be sorted out through discussion on MS Teams, followed by discussion during team meetings and if no solution found then further escalation to Shantanu Barua or Dr. Yakub as last resort.

v.Decision-Making

Team decisions will be made based on discussions among members and will be based on consensus. Documentation of desicions will be recorded in the minutes of our MS Teams meetings, and later on the ADR where it is related to the project and recorded on Github ADR file. 

vi. We accept that there can be individual disagreement with a decision reached, but once a consensus is reach by a majority of the team, all will commit to support the implementation of the decision regardless of prior indevidual stances. This is our Disagree and Commit clause. 


# Section 2: Academic Integrity and Use of AI 

All members of the team should comply with the academic policies of CDU concerning academic integrity. AI systems (such as ChatGPT or Copilot) can be utilized merely as auxiliary tools rather than proxies to understanding concepts or doing original work.

In order to reduce possible threats arising from the use of AI systems, the following control measures have been agreed upon:

i. Threat: Blind trust in AI-created content (possible inaccuracy or poor quality)

- All AI-created code and text will need to be manually verified before implementation.
- The team member who uses AI will need to be able to explain the underlying logic.

ii. Threat: Plagiarism or non-original work

- AI-produced materials will be further reworked and applied to original work.
- There will be no unaltered copy-paste in any document submitted for assessment.
- Sources of influence should be disclosed when relevant.

iii. Threat: Lack of common understanding within the team

- All works assisted by AI should be explained by the team member to another team member.
- Peer review of all materials is required.

iv. Threat: Overusing AI by individual members of the team

- Original contributions from each team member are required.
- Purely AI-produced tasks with little-to-no human input won't be considered acceptable.

v. Documentation requirement

- Any usage of AI needs to be mentioned briefly in the document (the name of the software and its purpose).

Any abuse of AI or breach of academic policy will be addressed first in the team and possibly reported to the lecturer if needed.

# Section 3: Delays & Extensions 

In order to secure project continuity, delay management shall be carried out as follows:

i. Early Notification

Any member expecting to experience delay should inform the team using Microsoft Teams not less than 48 hours before the internal deadline, giving reasons and indicating when the work is likely to be done.

ii. Immediate Team Support

After such a notification, the following steps shall be taken by the team:
- assessing the impact of such delay on milestones;
- offering help (clarification and/or pairing, etc.);
- modifying internal timelines wherever possible.

iii. Reassignment of Tasks

If any task has not been completed within 24–48 hours after the deadline and is not justified, it may be assigned to someone else. Task reassignments will be reported in GitHub Issues.

iv. Documenting and Holding Accountable

All delays along with actions taken in connection with them (i.e., support, reassignment, etc.) will be documented in Microsoft Teams and GitHub in order to make sure that contributions will be evaluated fairly.

v. Request for Extension

In case any deadline affects a key deliverable, the team will consider whether or not to ask the lecturer for an extension based on the evidence available. Such a request will follow CDU procedures.

vi. Repeated Delay

A repeated failure to observe a deadline without justifiable reason will be communicated to the lecturer, who may take necessary action to adjust grades accordingly.

# Section 4: Grade Expectations 

All group members aim at Distinction or High Distinction through providing work that matches the standards and quality criteria stated in the rubric of the assignment, not just through completing the tasks.
The solution is expected to show sufficient explanation for design choices as well as implementations.Multiple approaches need to be explored and contrasted before reaching the conclusion on how to proceed with the solution.Contributions must involve knowledge about design aspects in Django applications (such as designing models, optimizing QuerySets, and CBV design).
Finally, the resulting system is supposed to illustrate the integration of different features instead of presenting disjointed elements. In order to pass the task, it needs to be more than the fulfillment of basic requirements.


# Section 5: Support & Fair Assistance Policy 

The team agrees that its members might need help because of any challenges, heavy workload, or other factors. The assistance is given in a structured manner so that it would not damage the teamwork and individual responsibility.

i. Quick Assistance

The members are supposed to apply for assistance right after any problems appear and not to wait until the deadline. It has to be done through Microsoft Teams with an explanation of the problem.

ii. What Type of Help Can Be Offered?

Assistance can include:
- explanation of requirements
- solving the problem together
- giving some examples and other resources
- reviewing and providing feedback

iii. How Not to Shift Work to Others

The original task owner remains responsible for completing the work
Supporting members guide and assist, but do not take over the entire task unless formally reassigned
Any significant redistribution of work will be documented in GitHub Issues 

iv. Redistributing Work in Cases When It Is Necessary

In case any of the team members is unable to continue work (for example, he/she is sick) the team is allowed to redistribute this work among its members. It will be:
- discussed among all team members
- noted in the project's issues
- taken into consideration in the evaluation of contribution

v. Avoiding Being Too Dependent on Others

Frequent requests for help which were not justified by some real reasons will be mentioned and reflected in the grade.

vi. Peer Learning Responsibility

The members are expected to understand everything they are working on. If someone gets some help, he/she has to be able to explain the result in detail.

# Section 6: Architectural Decision & Development Process 

  Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) will be maintained as an ongoing living document within the GitHub repository to capture any and all relevant architectural and implementation decisions.

i. Documentation of Decisions

Any and all major decisions made (such as model design, QuerySet implementation, view design, authentication method) should be documented in an ADR. These will contain the following information:
- background context of the problem
- proposed decision
- alternative solutions examined
- rationale for decision and its implications

ii. Revisions of Decisions

Decisions will be revised as necessary, and the old decision will be archived with links to the new entry, thus capturing the evolution of the system design.

iii. References in Code

Each ADR will include references to:
- pertinent GitHub commit messages were possible
- issues
- code elements implemented

iv. Technical Reviews

A technical review at each milestone should address the following items:
- model design and encapsulation
- performance of the QuerySets
- view design (CBV structure)
- separation of concerns in services layer
- design of authentication and authorization system

 v. Evaluation of Alternatives
 
Before making major decisions, the group will:
- meet on MS Teams, for Group 1 team
- examine one alternative solution
- compare and contrast benefits and drawbacks
- document decision-making rationale in ADR
